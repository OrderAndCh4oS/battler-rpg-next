# RPG Battler

The RPG Battler is a custom battle simulator that allows two characters to engage in a turn-based combat using various actions, such as attacks, blocks, dodges, and critical hits. The simulator follows a set of rules that govern how the combatants interact with each other, how their attacks are calculated, and how the winner is determined.

## Here are the rules for the RPG Battler:

 - The simulator requires two characters to engage in combat.

 - Each character has a set of attributes, including health, strength, dexterity, intelligence, armour, and weapons, which determine their combat abilities.

 - Each combatant has a number of attacks and an attack remainder that are calculated based on their dexterity and weapon speed.

 - The combatants take turns attacking each other until one of them is defeated.

 - Each attack has a hit chance, which is determined by the attacker's dexterity and intelligence, and the defender's dexterity.

 - The defender can block or dodge the attack, reducing or avoiding the damage, respectively.

 - A successful attack can result in a critical hit, which deals extra damage and has a chance of causing a wound.

 - The damage from an attack is calculated based on the attacker's strength, weapon damage, and the defender's armour.

 - The simulator keeps track of the combatants' health, and the winner is the combatant who reduces the other's health to zero.

 - After the battle is over, the simulator updates the combatants' experience points and levels based on their performance.

These rules allow for a complex and dynamic combat system that takes into account a variety of factors, including the combatants' abilities, weapons, and tactics, to determine the outcome of the battle.
